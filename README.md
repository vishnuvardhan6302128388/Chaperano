In this project let's build a Chaperano by applying the concepts we have learned till now.

**Completion Instructions**

1.** Header Section**:
    a. A search bar for searching products.
b. Icons for profile and cart.
2. Product List Section:
a. Display a grid/list of products based on the Figma design.
b. Each product card should include:
i. Product Image
ii. Product Name
iii. Price
iv. "View Product" and "Add to Cart" buttons.
c. Clicking "View Product" should redirect the user to a custom
"Thank You" page. There will be no product details page, so you
are required to design a Thank You page from scratch.
3. Add to Cart Modal:
a. Clicking “Add to Cart” on any product should open a modal that
displays the product’s details and an option to confirm adding the
product to the cart.
b. The modal design is included in the Figma file and should be
closely followed.


**Technologies Used**

In this project I used followin technologies:-

1 React-routers
2 Pagination
3 Modals
4 React-Components
5 React-Context


**Challenges faced during the project**:-

During this project I have faced many challenges. Initially I didn't know how to add pagination to the Product items and I don't know how to add modal after cliking the view product button. Then I have learned through some videos and with help of nxtwave.
